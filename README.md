Lookalike Demo
==============

Orange3 Lookalike Demo extends [Orange3](http://orange.biolab.si), a data mining software
package, with widgets for demonstration purposes. The add-on is designed for introducing primary and secondary school children to data mining and machine learning concepts in a fun way.
